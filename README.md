### 1. Title 
>MetaKicks - Virtual Price Tracking LG Styler ShoeCase

### 2. Proposal
>As the culture of collecting expensive designer, luxury 
and limited-edition sneakers grows among the MZ generation –
Millennials and Gen Z – LG’s internal research found that these
‘sneakerheads’ would benefit greatly from a solution that not only
made their cherished shoes stand out more, but also provided them
with the optimal care. and LG provides LG ThinQ applications to
connect its home appliances and consumers and provide consumers
with a better experience. So our team thought that it would be good
to virtualize the ShoeCase and manage it on the ThinQ app. By
storing nft sneakers in a MetaKicks, nft, which exists only virtually,
is collected as if it were stored in a LG Styler ShoeCase. In addition,
the limited edition of the shoe resell market has grown a lot, and
we decided to create this service to check the resale market price of
shoes in real time. Finally, we thought that the culture of collecting
shoes could be further activated by taking out the shoe case that
was only in my room on the web and creating a culture to share
each other’s shoes collections.
